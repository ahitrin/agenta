= Wow, what I've found!

Sometimes it's funny to walk among old projects taken from my abandoned HDD.
Here is the most interesting one.

.Project card

| Name | Agenta
| Description | Two crowds of units fight each other with minimal interaction with human.
| Years | About 2006
| Language | Java 2
| Why is it fun? | Demo app!

I was quite impressed by the fact that it was possible to build and run it without any significant change.
The only actual improvement needed was an addition of `build.gradle` and project layout modernization.
And then - magic! - units started to move and fight each other.
Java stands strong for compatibility with old code, and this is really cool!

A view of fighting units (despite they're just colored letters) is so pleasant!
I want to play more with its code.

NOTE: A retrospective record.
